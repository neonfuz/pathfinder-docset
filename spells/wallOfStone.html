   This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A
   <i>
    wall of stone
   </i>
   is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall&#39;s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike a
   <i>
    <a href="wallOfIron.html#wall-of-iron">
     wall of iron
    </a>
    ,
   </i>
   you can create a
   <i>
    wall of stone
   </i>
   in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell&#39;s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
   <i>
    <a href="disintegrate.html#disintegrate">
     disintegrate
    </a>
   </i>
   spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#strength">

   check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a
   <i>
    wall of stone
   </i>
   , provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful
