   You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the
   <i>
    sepia snake sigil
   </i>
   springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake&#39;s strike. If it succeeds, the
   <i>
    sepia snake
   </i>
   dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.
  </p>
  <p>
   While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#dying">
    dying
   </a>
   subject does not lose hit points or become
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#stable">
    stable
   </a>
   until the spell ends.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and
   <i>
    <a href="detectMagic.html#detect-magic">
     detect magic
    </a>
   </i>
   reveals only that the entire text is magical.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <i>
    <a href="dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic">
     dispel magic
    </a>
   </i>
   can remove the sigil. An
   <i>
    erase
   </i>
   spell destroys the entire page of text.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Sepia snake sigil
   </i>
   can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as
