   This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the
   <i>
    symbol
   </i>
   becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points&#39; worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the
   <i>
    symbol
   </i>
   only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the
   <i>
    symbol
   </i>
   is still active, it must save again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Until it is triggered, the
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   works normally.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a default, a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can&#39;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   &#39;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this case, &#34;reading&#34; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can&#39;t use a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   remains untriggered if an item bearing the
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   can be based on a creature&#39;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&#39;t qualify.
  </p>
  <p>
   When scribing a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   , you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol&#39;s effect
   <i>
    .
   </i>
   Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&#39;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
  </p>
  <p>
   You also can attune any number of creatures to the
   <i>
    symbol of death,
   </i>
   but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own
   <i>
    symbols of death
   </i>
   , and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    <a href="readMagic.html#read-magic">
     Read magic
    </a>
   </i>
   allows you to identify a
   <i>
    symbol
   </i>
   with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the
   <i>
    symbol&#39;s
   </i>
   spell level). Of course, if the
   <i>
    symbol
   </i>
   is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   can be removed by a successful
   <i>
    <a href="dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic">
     dispel magic
    </a>
   </i>
   targeted solely on the rune. An
   <i>
    erase
   </i>
   spell has no effect on a
   <i>
    symbol of death.
   </i>
   Destruction of the surface where a
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   is inscribed destroys the
   <i>
    symbol
   </i>
   but also triggers it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Symbol of death
   </i>
   can be made permanent with a
   <i>
    <a href="permanency.html#permanency">
     permanency
    </a>
   </i>
   spell. A permanent
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Note
   </i>
   : Magic traps such as
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for
   <i>
    symbol of death
   </i>
   .
