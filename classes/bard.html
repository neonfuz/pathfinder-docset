  <p>
   Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

    Role
   </b>
   : Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.

  <h2>
   Class Features

  <p>
   All of the following are class features of the bard.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency
   </b>
   : A bard is proficient with all
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/equipment.html#simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons">
    simple
   </a>
   weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are also proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor and use a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

   Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on
   <a href="#table-3-3-bard">
    Table: Bard
   </a>
   . In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#charisma-new">
    Charisma
   </a>
   score (see
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells">
    Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The bard&#39;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the bard&#39;s choice. At each new bard level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on
   <a href="#table-3-4-bard-spells-known">
    Table: Bard Spells Known
   </a>
   . (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#charisma-new">
    Charisma
   </a>
   score. The numbers on
   <a href="#table-3-4-bard-spells-known">
    Table: Bard Spells Known
   </a>
   are fixed.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard &#34;loses&#34; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#39;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
  </p>
  <p>
   A bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#39;s level.

   skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his

    Charisma
   </a>
   modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.
  </p>
  <p>
   Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed,

  </p>
  <p>
   At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.
