   Ranger
  </h1>
  <p>
   For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among their own people.

  </p>
  <p>
   If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from—those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger&#39;s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

  </p>
  <p>
   To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

   The benefits of the ranger&#39;s chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.

   </b>
   : At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger&#39;s
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#wisdom">
    Wisdom
   </a>
   modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.

  <p>
   The second option is to form a close bond with an
   <a href="druid.html#animal-companions-184">
    animal companion
   </a>
   . A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat, dog, horse, pony, snake (viper or constrictor), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger&#39;s animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.
  </p>
  <p>
   This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger&#39;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level – 3.

    Spells

    Spell Lists
   </a>
   . A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.

   Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high

   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells">
    Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells
   </a>
   ). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#wisdom">
    Wisdom
   </a>
   score for that spell level.
  </p>
  <p>
   A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.
  </p>

   Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level – 3.

A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature&#39;s type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.
