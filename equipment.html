   Each character begins play with a number of gold pieces that he can spend on weapons, armor, and other equipment. As a character adventures, he accumulates more wealth that can be spent on better gear and magic items. Table: Starting Character Wealth lists the starting gold piece values by class. In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. For characters above 1st level, see Table: Character Wealth by Level.

   The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces (sp). Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.
  </p>
  <p>
   The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (50 to the pound).

   Selling Treasure
  </h2>
  <p>
   In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price, including weapons, armor, gear, and magic items. This also includes character-created items.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.
  </p>
  <h1 id="weapons">
   Weapons
  </h1>
  <p>
   From the common longsword to the exotic dwarven urgrosh, weapons come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
  </p>
  <p>
   All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll is equal or greater than the target&#39;s
   <a href="combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   , the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon&#39;s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon&#39;s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).
  </p>
  <p id="simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons">
   <b>
    Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons
   </b>
   : Anybody but a druid, monk, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons possessed by their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Melee and Ranged Weapons
   </b>
   : Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.
  </p>
  <p id="reach-weapons">
   <i>
    Reach Weapons
   </i>
   : Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren&#39;t adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder&#39;s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.
  </p>
  <p id="double-weapons">
   <i>
    Double Weapons
   </i>
   : Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaves, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with
   <a href="combat.html#two-weapon-fighting">
    two-weapon combat
   </a>
   , just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The character can also choose to use a double weapon two-handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can&#39;t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
  </p>
  <p id="thrown-weapons">
   <i>
    Thrown Weapons
   </i>
   : Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn&#39;t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn&#39;t have a numeric entry in the Range column on Table: Weapons), and a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
  </p>
  <p id="projectile-weapons">
   <i>
    Projectile Weapons
   </i>
   : Blowguns, light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, halfling sling staves, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it&#39;s a specially built composite shortbow or longbow, or a sling. If the character has a penalty for low
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   , apply it to damage rolls when he uses a bow or a sling.
  </p>
  <p id="ammunition">
   <i>
    Ammunition
   </i>
   : Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), darts (for blowguns), or sling bullets (for slings and halfling sling staves). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting

    Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons

   : This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon&#39;s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

   bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.
  </p>
  <p id="weapon-size">
   <b>
    Weapon Size
   </b>
   : Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.
  </p>
  <p>
   A weapon&#39;s size category isn&#39;t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon&#39;s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.
  </p>
  <p id="inappropriately-sized-weapons">
   <i>
    Inappropriately Sized Weapons
   </i>
   : A creature can&#39;t make optimum use of a weapon that isn&#39;t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn&#39;t proficient with the weapon, a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder&#39;s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon&#39;s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can&#39;t wield the weapon at all.
  </p>
  <p id="improvised-weapons">
   <b>
    Improvised Weapons
   </b>
   : Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

   <b>
    Dmg
   </b>
   : These columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled &#34;Dmg (S)&#34; is for Small weapons. The column labeled &#34;Dmg (M)&#34; is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given, then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon&#39;s extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for Tiny and Large weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Critical
   </b>
   : The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.
  </p>
  <p>
   Extra damage over and above a weapon&#39;s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Range
   </b>
   : Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a –4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Weight
   </b>
   : This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons. Some weapons have a special weight. See the weapon&#39;s description for details.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Type
   </b>
   : Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Special
   </b>
   : Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.
  </p>
  <p id="brace">
   <i>
    Brace
   </i>
   : If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character (see
   <a href="combat.html">
    Combat
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p id="disarm">
   <i>
    Disarm
   </i>
   : When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Double
   </i>
   : You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
  </p>
  <p id="monk">
   <i>
    Monk
   </i>
   : A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows (see
   <a href="classes.html">
    Classes
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p id="nonlethal">
   <i>
    Nonlethal
   </i>
   : These weapons deal nonlethal damage (see
   <a href="combat.html">
    Combat
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Reach
   </i>
   : You use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can&#39;t use it against an adjacent foe.
  </p>
  <p id="trip">
   <i>
    Trip
   </i>
   : You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.

   : A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length, covered in wicked barbs. You can use the
   <a href="feats.html#weapon-finesse">
    Weapon Finesse
   </a>
   feat to apply your
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#dexterity">
    Dexterity

   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Crossbow, Hand
   </b>
   : You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with
   <a href="combat.html#two-weapon-fighting">

   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Crossbow, Heavy
   </b>
   : You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with
   <a href="combat.html#two-weapon-fighting">
    two one-handed weapons
   </a>
   . This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Crossbow, Light
   </b>
   : You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a –2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with
   <a href="combat.html#two-weapon-fighting">
    two light weapons
   </a>
   . This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Crossbow, Repeating
   </b>
   : The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Curve Blade, Elven
   </b>
   : Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade due to its flexible metal.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Gauntlet
   </b>
   : This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of gauntlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Hammer, Gnome Hooked
   </b>
   : A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon—an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer&#39;s blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit ×3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit ×4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Javelin
   </b>
   : A javelin is a thin throwing spear. Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Kama
   </b>
   : Similar to a sickle, a kama is a short, curved blade attached to a simple handle.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Kukri

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Longbow
   </b>
   : At almost 5 feet in height, a longbow is made up of one solid piece of carefully curved wood. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   , apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   bonus, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below), but not when you use a regular longbow.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Longbow, Composite
   </b>
   : You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum

   modifier to use with proficiency). If your
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">

   : A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net&#39;s maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is
   <a href="glossary.html#entangled">

  </p>
  <p>
   An

    Strength
   </a>
   check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.
  </p>
  <p>
   A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.

    Shortsword
   </b>
   : This sword is about 2 feet in length.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Shuriken
   </b>
   : A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for throwing. A shuriken can&#39;t be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what happens to them after they are thrown.

   <b>
    Siangham
   </b>
   : This weapon is a handheld shaft fitted with a pointed tip for stabbing foes.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Sling
   </b>
   : A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Sling Staff, Halfling
   </b>
   : Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your

    Strength
   </a>
   modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

   You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons.
  </p>

   <b>
    Spear
   </b>
   : A spear is 5 feet in length and can be thrown.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Spiked Armor

   <b>
    Starknife
   </b>
   : From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend like points on a compass rose. A wielder can stab with the starknife or throw it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Strike, Unarmed
   </b>
   : A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the
   <a href="feats.html#improved-unarmed-strike">
    Improved Unarmed Strike
   </a>
   feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at his discretion. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the
   <a href="feats.html#weapon-finesse">

   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Sword, Bastard
   </b>
   : A bastard sword is about 4 feet in length, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Sword, Two-Bladed
   </b>
   : A two-bladed sword is a double weapon—twin blades extend from either side of a central, short haft, allowing the wielder to attack with graceful but deadly flourishes.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Trident
   </b>
   : A trident has three metal prongs at end of a 4-foot-long shaft. This weapon can be thrown.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Urgrosh, Dwarven
   </b>
   : A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon—an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh&#39;s axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Waraxe, Dwarven
   </b>
   : A dwarven waraxe has a large, ornate head mounted to a thick handle, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Whip
   </b>
   : A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don&#39;t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).
  </p>
  <p>
   Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can use the
   <a href="feats.html#weapon-finesse">
    Weapon Finesse
   </a>
   feat to apply your
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#dexterity">
    Dexterity

  </p>
  <h2 id="masterwork-weapons">
   Masterwork Weapons
  </h2>
  <p>
   A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can&#39;t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).
  </p>
  <p>
   Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.
  </p>
  <p>
   All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn&#39;t stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon&#39;s magic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can&#39;t create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.
  </p>
  <h1 id="armor">
   Armor
  </h1>
  <p>
   For most, armor is the simplest way to protect oneself in a world of rampant threats and dangers. Many characters can wear only the simplest of armors, and only some can use shields. To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.

    Arcane Spell Failure Chance

   : Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they&#39;re wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor and use shields without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.

If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.

  <p>
   Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described below.
  </p>
  <p id="armor-spikes">
   <b>
    Armor Spikes
   </b>
   : You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage (see &#34;spiked armor&#34; on Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can&#39;t also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.) An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes&#39; effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Banded Mail
   </b>
   : Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a leather backing. The suit includes gauntlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Breastplate
   </b>
   : Covering only the torso, a breastplate is made up of a single piece of sculpted metal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Buckler
   </b>
   : This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler&#39;s
   <a href="combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   bonus until your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler&#39;s
   <a href="combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   bonus until your next turn. You can&#39;t make a shield bash with a buckler.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Chain Shirt
   </b>
   : Covering the torso, this shirt is made up of thousands of interlocking metal rings.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Chainmail
   </b>
   : Unlike a chain shirt, chainmail covers the legs and arms of the wearer. The suit includes gauntlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Full Plate
   </b>
   : This metal suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 × 100) gold pieces.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Gauntlet, Locked
   </b>
   : This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you&#39;re wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the gauntlet is locked, you can&#39;t use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Half-Plate
   </b>
   : Combining elements of full plate and chainmail, half-plate includes gauntlets and a helm.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Hide
   </b>
   : Hide armor is made up of the tanned and preserved skin of any thick-hided beast.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>

   Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.

   A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.

  <p>
   The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.
  </p>

   You can&#39;t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.

   Special Materials
  </h1>
  <p>
   Weapons and armor can be crafted using materials that possess innate special properties. If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of the special materials described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have damage reduction making them resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular material. Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons, depending upon the types of creatures they most commonly encounter.
  </p>
  <p id="adamantine">
   <b>
    Adamantine
   </b>
   : Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, this ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20 (see
   <a href="additionalRules.html">
    Additional Rules
   </a>
   ). Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/— if it&#39;s light armor, 2/— if it&#39;s medium armor, and 3/— if it&#39;s heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons and armor normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

    Darkwood
   </b>
   : This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow or spear) made from darkwood is considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood. The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.

   Darkwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.

  <p id="dragonhide">
   <b>
    Dragonhide
   </b>
   : Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a light or heavy masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger. If the dragonhide comes from a dragon that had immunity to an energy type, the armor is also immune to that energy type, although this does not confer any protection to the wearer. If the armor or shield is later given the ability to protect the wearer against that energy type, the cost to add such protection is reduced by 25%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because dragonhide armor isn&#39;t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dragonhide armor costs twice as much as masterwork armor of that type, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type (double all Craft results).
  </p>
  <p>
   Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. The hide of a dragon is typically between 1/2 inch and 1 inch thick.

   <b>
    Iron, Cold
   </b>
   : This iron, mined deep underground and known for its effectiveness against demons and fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, adding any magical enhancements to a cold iron weapon increases its price by 2,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added.
  </p>
  <p>
   Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not. A double weapon with one cold iron half costs 50% more than normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.
  </p>
  <p id="mithral">
   <b>
    Mithral
   </b>
   : Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor, and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. A character wearing mithral full plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armor&#39;s check penalty to all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#dexterity">
    Dexterity
   </a>
   bonuses are increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).
  </p>
  <p>
   An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon&#39;s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a quarterstaff cannot.) Mithral weapons count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.

  <p>
   Beyond armor and weapons, a character can carry a whole variety of gear, from rations (to sustain him on long travels), to rope (which is useful in countless circumstances). Most of the common gear carried by adventurers is summarized on Table: Goods and Services.
  </p>
  <h2 id="adventuring-gear">
   Adventuring Gear
  </h2>
  <p>
   Some of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (&#34;you&#34;).
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Caltrops
   </b>
   : A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature&#39;s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to
   <a href="combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   . If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature&#39;s speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Candle
   </b>
   : A candle dimly illuminates a small area, increasing the
   <a href="additionalRules.html#vision-and-light">
    light level
   </a>
   in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Chain
   </b>
   : Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   check.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Crowbar
   </b>
   : A crowbar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   checks made to force open a door or chest. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Flint and Steel
   </b>
   : Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Grappling Hook
   </b>
   : Throwing a grappling hook requires a ranged attack roll, treating the hook as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Objects with ample places to catch the hook are
   <a href="combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   5.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Hammer
   </b>
   : If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Ink
   </b>
   : Ink in colors other than black costs twice as much.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Jug, Clay
   </b>
   : This basic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Lamp, Common
   </b>
   : A lamp illuminates a small area, providing normal light in a 15-foot radius and increasing the
   <a href="additionalRules.html#vision-and-light">
    light level
   </a>
   by one step for an additional 15 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A lamp does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lamp burns for 6 hours on one pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Lantern, Bullseye
   </b>
   : A bullseye lantern provides normal light in a 60-foot cone and increases the
   <a href="additionalRules.html#vision-and-light">
    light level
   </a>
   by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 120-foot cone (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A bullseye lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on one pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Lantern, Hooded
   </b>
   : A hooded lantern sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the
   <a href="additionalRules.html#vision-and-light">
    light level
   </a>
   by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A hooded lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on one pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Lock
   </b>
   : The DC to open a lock with the Disable Device skill depends on the lock&#39;s quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Manacles, Standard and Masterwork
   </b>
   : Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Oil
   </b>
   : A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp. You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist&#39;s fire (see Special Substances and Items on Table: Goods and Services), except that it takes a full-round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Pick, Miner&#39;s
   </b>
   : If a miner&#39;s pick is used in combat, treat it as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals piercing damage equal to that of a heavy pick of its size.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Ram, Portable
   </b>
   : This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength

   checks made to break open a door and allows a second person to help, automatically increasing your bonus by 2.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Rope, Hemp
   </b>
   : This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23

   check.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Rope, Silk
   </b>
   : This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   check.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Shovel
   </b>
   : If a shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Spyglass
   </b>
   : Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Characters using a spyglass take a –1 penalty on Perception skill checks per 20 feet of distance to the target, if the target is visible.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Torch
   </b>
   : A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Vial
   </b>
   : A vial is made out of glass or steel and holds 1 ounce of liquid.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Water Clock
   </b>
   : This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurately to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.
  </p>
  <h2 id="special-substances-and-items">
   Special Substances and Items
  </h2>
  <p>
   Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Acid
   </b>
   : You can throw a flask of acid as a
   <a href="combat.html#throw-splash-weapon">
    splash weapon
   </a>
   . Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Alchemist&#39;s Fire
   </b>
   : You can throw a flask of alchemist&#39;s fire as a
   <a href="combat.html#throw-splash-weapon">
    splash weapon
   </a>
   . Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
  </p>
  <p>
   A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15
   <a href="combat.html#reflex">
    Reflex
   </a>
   save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Antitoxin
   </b>
   : If you drink a vial of antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on
   <a href="combat.html#fortitude">
    Fortitude
   </a>
   saving throws against poison for 1 hour.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Everburning Torch
   </b>
   : This otherwise normal torch has a
   <i>
    continual flame
   </i>
   spell cast on it. This causes it to shed light like an ordinary torch, but it does not emit heat or deal fire damage if used as a weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Holy Water
   </b>
   : Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit). Holy water is made using the
   <i>
    bless water
   </i>
   spell.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Smokestick
   </b>
   : This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a
   <i>
    fog cloud
   </i>
   spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Sunrod
   </b>
   : This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck as a standard action. It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A sunrod does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Tanglefoot Bag
   </b>
   : A tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin, and other sticky substances. When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An
   <a href="glossary.html#entangled">

   </a>
   creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to

   and must make a DC 15

   </a>
   save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.
  </p>
  <p>
   A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17
   <a href="gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the
   <a href="glossary.html#entangled">
    entangled
   </a>
   creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell&#39;s level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of
   <i>
    universal solvent
   </i>
   to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Thunderstone
   </b>
   : You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15

  </p>
  <p>
   Since you don&#39;t need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as

   </a>
   5.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Tindertwig
   </b>
   : The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

   : This set of clothes is for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak.

   <b>
    Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature
   </b>
   : Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as human armor (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much (see Table: Armor for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flying mounts can&#39;t fly in medium or heavy barding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than a rider and normal saddlebags.

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Donkey or Mule
   </b>
   : Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Feed
   </b>
   : Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it meat.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Horse
   </b>
   : A horse is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.

   Sometimes the best solution to a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.

  <p>
   <b>
    Coach Cab
   </b>
   : The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Hireling, Trained
   </b>
   : The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, cooks, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Hireling, Untrained
   </b>
   : The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, maids, and other menial workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Messenger
   </b>
   : This includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Road or Gate Toll
   </b>
   : A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-kept and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large, walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Ship&#39;s Passage
   </b>
   : Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Spellcasting
   </b>
   : The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him, and the default answer is no.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cost given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn&#39;t certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren&#39;t returning with the caster.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn&#39;t guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.
