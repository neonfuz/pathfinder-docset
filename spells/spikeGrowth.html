   Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell&#39;s area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically,
   <i>
    spike growth
   </i>
   can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell&#39;s area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#reflex">

   </a>
   save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a
   <i>
    cure
   </i>
   spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&#39;s save DC.
  </p>

   Magic traps are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a
   <i>
    spike growth
   </i>
   . The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 28 for
   <i>
    spike growth
   </i>
   (or DC 27 for
   <i>
    spike growth
   </i>
   cast by a ranger).
   <i>
    Spike growth
   </i>
   can&#39;t be disabled with the Disable Device skill.
