   This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear, burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that
   <i>
    black tentacles
   </i>
   is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles&#39;
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#combat-maneuver-bonus">
    CMB
   </a>
   , the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#grappled">
    grappled
   </a>
   condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The
   <i>
    black tentacles
   </i>
   spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that
   <i>
    black tentacles
   </i>
   succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense">
    CMD
   </a>
   of
   <i>
    black tentacles
   </i>
   , for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#combat-maneuver-bonus">
    CMB
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.
