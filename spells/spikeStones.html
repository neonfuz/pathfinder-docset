   impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell&#39;s area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.

   Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#reflex">

   </a>
   save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature&#39;s speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a
   <i>
    cure
   </i>
   spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&#39;s save DC.
