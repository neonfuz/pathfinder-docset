   Artifacts
  </h1>
  <p>
   Artifacts are extremely powerful. Rather than merely another form of magical equipment, they are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns can be based on. Each could be the center of a whole set of adventures—a quest to recover it, a fight against an opponent wielding it, a mission to cause its destruction, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike normal magic items, artifacts are not easily destroyed. Instead of construction information, each artifact includes one possible means by which it might be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Artifacts can never be purchased, nor are they found as part of a random treasure hoard. When placing an artifact in your game, be sure to consider its impact and role. Remember that artifacts are fickle objects, and if they become too much of a nuisance, they can easily disappear or become lost once again.
  </p>
  <h2 id="minor-artifacts">
   Minor Artifacts
  </h2>
  <p>
   Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that no longer can be created, at least by common mortal means.

   Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back—paging through a
   <i>
    book of infinite spells
   </i>
   is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character&#39;s class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook—their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.

  <p>
   A
   <i>
    deck of many things
   </i>
   (both beneficial and malign) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.
  </p>
  <p>
   The character with a
   <i>
    deck of many things
   </i>
   who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A
   <i>
    deck of many things
   </i>
   contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below.

   <i>
    The Fates
   </i>
   : This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.

    Flames

Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.

   : When this card is drawn, one of the character&#39;s NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.

    Throne

  <p>
   <i>
    Vizier
   </i>
   : This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely.

    The Void

   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft">

   </a>
   (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single
   <i>
    philosopher&#39;s stone
   </i>
   can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a

  <p>
   A
   <i>
    sphere of annihilation
   </i>
   is a globe of absolute blackness 2 feet in diameter. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <i>
    sphere of annihilation
   </i>
   is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of
   <i>
    <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/telekinesis.html#telekinesis">
     telekinesis
    </a>
   </i>
   , too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character&#39;s ability to gain control of a
   <i>
    sphere of annihilation
   </i>
   (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#intelligence">
    Int
   </a>
   modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.
  </p>
  <p>
   Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere&#39;s speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character&#39;s control check result in that round exceeded 30.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a
   <i>
    sphere of annihilation
   </i>
   , the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.

All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 23

   The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her (no saving throw).

   Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the
   <i>
    Codex
   </i>
   (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The
   <i>
    Codex of the Infinite Planes
   </i>
   has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft">
    Spellcraft
   </a>
   check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can&#39;t take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use.

  <p>
   Each of these fabled
   <i>
    Orbs
   </i>
   contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an
   <i>
    Orb
   </i>
   can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as
   <i>
    dominate monster
   </i>
   ), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#will">

   </a>
   save to resist.
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#spell-resistance">
    Spell resistance
   </a>
   is not useful against this effect. Each
   <i>
    Orb of Dragonkind
   </i>
   bestows upon the wielder the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the
   <i>
    Orb.
   </i>
   A character possessing an
   <i>
    Orb of Dragonkind
   </i>
   is immune to the breath weapon—but only the breath weapon—of the dragon variety keyed to the
   <i>
    Orb.
   </i>
   Finally, a character possessing an
   <i>
    Orb
   </i>
   can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the
   <i>
    Orb
   </i>
   three times per day.
  </p>
  <p>
   All
   <i>
    Orbs of Dragonkind
   </i>
   can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other
   <i>
    Orbs
   </i>
   . The owner of an
   <i>
    Orb
   </i>
   knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the
   <i>
    Orb&#39;s
   </i>
   particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the
   <i>
    Orb&#39;s
   </i>
   variety, the wielder can determine the dragon&#39;s exact location and age. The bearer of one of these
   <i>
    Orbs
   </i>
   earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each
   <i>
    Orb
   </i>
   also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th.
