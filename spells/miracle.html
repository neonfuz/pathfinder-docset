   You don&#39;t so much cast a
   <i>
    miracle
   </i>
   as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <i>
    miracle
   </i>
   can do any of the following things.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.
   </li>
   <li>
    Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
   </li>
   <li>
    Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as
    <i>
     <a href="feeblemind.html#feeblemind">
      feeblemind
     </a>
    </i>
    or
    <i>
     <a href="insanity.html#insanity">
      insanity
     </a>
    </i>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a
   <i>
    miracle
   </i>
   costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful
   <i>
    miracles
   </i>
   of this sort could include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
   </li>
   <li>
    Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.
   </li>
   <li>
    Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity&#39;s (or alignment&#39;s) nature is refused.
  </p>
  <p>
   A duplicated spell allows saving throws and
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#spell-resistance">
    spell resistance
   </a>
   as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a
   <i>
    miracle
   </i>
   spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
