   You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The
   <i>
    suggestion
   </i>
   must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
  </p>
  <p>
   The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.
  </p>
  <p>
   A very reasonable
   <i>
    suggestion
   </i>
   causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as –1 or –2).

   , except that it can affect more creatures. The same
