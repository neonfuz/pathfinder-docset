   You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Approach
   </i>
   : On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Drop
   </i>
   : On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can&#39;t pick up any dropped item until its next turn.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Fall
   </i>
   : On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#prone">
    prone
   </a>
   for 1 round. It may act normally while
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#prone">
    prone
   </a>
   but takes any appropriate penalties.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Flee
   </i>
   : On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Halt
   </i>
   : The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered

    helpless

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   If the subject can&#39;t carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.
