   You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The
   <i>
    whispering wind
   </i>
   travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A
   <i>
    whispering wind
   </i>
   is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the
   <i>
    whispering wind
   </i>
   seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the
   <i>
    whispering wind
   </i>
   to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with
   <i>
    magic mouth, whispering wind
   </i>
   cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
