   You know how to swim and can do so even in stormy water.

   <b>
    Check
   </b>
   : Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to half your speed (as a full-round action) or at a quarter of your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#constitution">
    Constitution
   </a>
   score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#constitution">
    Constitution
   </a>
   check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#constitution">
    Constitution
   </a>
   check, you begin to drown. The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.

   Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

    Action
   </b>
   : A successful Swim check allows you to swim a quarter of your speed as a move action or half your speed as a full-round action.

   <b>
    Special
   </b>
   : A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.
