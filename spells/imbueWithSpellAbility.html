   Once you cast
   <i>
    imbue with spell ability,
   </i>
   you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the
   <i>
    imbue with spell ability
   </i>
   spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active
   <i>
    imbue with spell ability
   </i>
   spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.

   To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must be able to move freely. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus.
