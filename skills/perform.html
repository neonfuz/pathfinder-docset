   You are skilled at one form of entertainment, from singing to acting to playing an instrument. Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small sample of which is provided for each category below.

  <ul>
   <li>
    Act (comedy, drama, pantomime)

   <li>
    Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
   </li>

    Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)

    Action
   </b>
   : Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening&#39;s work to a full day&#39;s performance. The bard&#39;s special Perform-based abilities are described in that class&#39;s description.

   <b>
    Try Again
   </b>
   : Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don&#39;t negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)
