  <p>
   You are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Check
   </b>
   : When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don&#39;t necessarily know whether you&#39;ve succeeded.
  </p>
  <p>
   The DC depends on how tricky the device is. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you trigger it. If you&#39;re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.
  </p>
  <p>
   You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

    Open Locks
   </i>
   : The DC for opening a lock depends on its quality. If you do not have a set of thieves&#39; tools, these DCs increase by 10.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Action
   </b>
   : The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. A tricky or difficult device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. Attempting to open a lock is a full-round action.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Try Again
   </b>
   : Varies. You can retry checks made to disable traps if you miss the check by 4 or less. You can retry checks made to open locks.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Special
   </b>
   : If you have the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#deft-hands">
    Deft Hands
   </a>
   feat, you get a bonus on Disable Device checks (see
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html">
    Feats
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   A rogue who beats a trap&#39;s DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it without disarming it. A rogue can rig a trap so her allies can bypass it as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Restriction
   </b>
   : Characters with the trapfinding ability (like rogues) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The spells
   <i>
    fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    teleportation circle
   </i>
   also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check.
   <i>
    Spike growth
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    spike stones,
   </i>
   however, create magic hazards against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.
