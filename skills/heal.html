   <i>
    First Aid
   </i>
   : You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#appendix-2-conditions">
    Conditions
   </a>
   for rules on bleed damage).
  </p>
  <p id="long-term-care">
   <i>
    Long-Term Care
   </i>
   : Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones
   </i>
   : A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.
  </p>
  <p>
   A creature wounded by a
   <i>
    spike growth
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    spike stones
   </i>
   spell must succeed on a
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#reflex">
    Reflex
   </a>
   save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim&#39;s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&#39;s save DC.
  </p>
  <p id="treat-deadly-wounds">
   <i>
    Treat Deadly Wounds
   </i>
   : When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#wisdom">
    Wisdom
   </a>
   modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a healer&#39;s kit to perform this task. You take a –2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer&#39;s kit that you lack.
  </p>
  <p id="treat-poison">
   <i>
    Treat Poison
   </i>
   : To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison.
  </p>
  <p id="treat-disease">
   <i>
    Treat Disease
   </i>
   : To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Action
   </b>
   : Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a
   <i>
    spike growth
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    spike stones
   </i>
   spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Try Again
   </b>
   : Varies. Generally speaking, you can&#39;t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check&#39;s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Special
   </b>
   : A character with the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#self-sufficient">
    Self-Sufficient
   </a>
   feat gets a bonus on Heal checks (see
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html">
    Feats
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   A healer&#39;s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.
