   You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell&#39;s area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell&#39;s area.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier&#39;s result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from you.
