   You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#will">
    Will
   </a>
   save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a
   <i>
    shadow evocation,
   </i>
   a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#spell-resistance">
    spell resistance
   </a>
   ) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to
   <i>
    shadow evocation&#39;
   </i>
   s level (5th) rather than the spell&#39;s normal level.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Objects automatically succeed on their
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#will">

   saves against this spell.
