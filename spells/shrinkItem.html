   You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object&#39;s size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a
   <i>
    shrink item
   </i>
   spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Shrink item
   </i>
   can be made permanent with a
   <i>
    <a href="permanency.html#permanency">
     permanency
    </a>
   </i>
   spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.
