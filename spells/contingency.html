   You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting
   <i>
    contingency
   </i>
   . The
   <i>
    contingency
   </i>
   spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast
   <i>
    contingency.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   The spell to be brought into effect by the
   <i>
    contingency
   </i>
   must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).
  </p>
  <p>
   The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the
   <i>
    contingency
   </i>
   immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being &#34;cast&#34; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (
   <i>
    contingency
   </i>
   and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can use only one
   <i>
    contingency
   </i>
   spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.
