   This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a threat range of 18–20 becomes 15–20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the
   <i>
    keen edge
   </i>
   on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.
  </p>
  <p>
   Multiple effects that increase a weapon&#39;s threat range (such as the
   <i>
    keen
   </i>
   special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don&#39;t stack. You can&#39;t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.
