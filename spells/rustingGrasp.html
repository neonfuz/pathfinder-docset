   Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.

   You may employ
   <i>
    rusting grasp
   </i>
   in combat with a successful melee touch attack.
   <i>
    Rusting grasp
   </i>
   used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offers) through corrosion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an opponent&#39;s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.
  </p>
  <p>
   Against a ferrous creature,
   <i>
    rusting grasp
   </i>
   instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.
