   Monk
  </h1>
  <p>
   For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield—it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.

   All of the following are class features of the monk.

    Weapon and Armor Proficiency

   : Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shortspear, short sword, shuriken, siangham, sling, and spear.
  </p>
  <p>
   Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
  </p>
  <p>
   When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his

   : When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his

   and his
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense">
    CMD

   . In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#armor-class">

   and
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense">

  </p>
  <p>
   These bonuses to
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#armor-class">

   apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is

    Flurry of Blows
    <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#extraordinary-abilities-ex">
     (Ex)
    </a>
   </b>
   : Starting at 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When doing so, he may make on additional attack, taking a -2 penalty on all of his attack rolls, as if using the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#two-weapon-fighting">
    Two-Weapon Fighting
   </a>
   feat. These attacks can be any combination of unarmed strikes and attacks with a monk special weapon (he does not need to use two weapons to use this ability). For the purpose of these attacks, the monk&#39;s base attack bonus from his monk class levels is equal to his monk level. For all other purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses his normal base attack bonus.
  </p>
  <p>
   At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he uses flurry of blows, as if using
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-two-weapon-fighting">
    Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
   </a>
   (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).
  </p>
  <p>
   At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows, as if using
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#greater-two-weapon-fighting">
    Greater Two-Weapon Fighting
   </a>
   (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).
  </p>
  <p>
   A monk applies his full
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands. A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows. A monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. A monk with natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can he make natural attacks in addition to his flurry of blows attacks.
  </p>
  <p id="unarmed-strike">
   <b>
    Unarmed Strike
   </b>
   : At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#39;s attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply his full
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#strength">
    Strength
   </a>
   bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Usually a monk&#39;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.
  </p>
  <p>
   A monk&#39;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown above on Table: Monk. The unarmed damage values listed on Table: Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with his unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage on the table given below.
