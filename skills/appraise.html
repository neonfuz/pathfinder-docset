   You can evaluate the monetary value of an object.

   <b>
    Check
   </b>
   : A DC 20 Appraise check determines the value of a common item. If you succeed by 5 or more, you also determine if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic item&#39;s abilities. If your fail the check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. Particularly rare or exotic items might increase the DC of this check by 5 or more.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.
  </p>

   <b>
    Action
   </b>
   : Appraising an item takes 1 standard action. Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Try Again
   </b>
   : Additional attempts to Appraise an item reveal the same result.

    Special
   </b>
   : A spellcaster with a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.
