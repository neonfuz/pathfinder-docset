   A
   <i>
    limited wish
   </i>
   lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a
   <i>
    limited wish
   </i>
   can do any of the following things.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
   </li>
   <li>
    Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
   </li>
   <li>
    Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
   </li>
   <li>
    Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
   </li>
   <li>
    Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as
    <i>
     geas/quest
    </i>
    or
    <i>
     <a href="insanity.html#insanity">
      insanity
     </a>
    </i>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a –7 penalty on its next saving throw.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   A duplicated spell allows saving throws and
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#spell-resistance">
    spell resistance
   </a>
   as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a
   <i>
    limited wish
   </i>
   spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).
