   : The DC noted is for getting through a space through which your head fits but your shoulders don&#39;t. If the space is long, you may need to make multiple checks. You can&#39;t squeeze through a space that your head does not fit through.

    Action
   </b>
   : Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an
   <i>
    animate rope, command plants, control plants,
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    entangle
   </i>
   spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Try Again
   </b>
   : Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you&#39;re squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you&#39;re not being actively opposed. If the DC to escape from rope or bindings is higher than 20 + your Escape Artist skill bonus, you cannot escape from the bonds using Escape Artist.
  </p>
