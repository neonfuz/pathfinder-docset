   <b>
    Check
   </b>
   : Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others&#39; Perception check results. If you don&#39;t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Perception checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks.
  </p>
  <p>
   You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people make Perception checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can&#39;t be sure how good the result is.
  </p>
  <p>
   The effectiveness of your disguise depends on how much you&#39;re changing your appearance. Disguise can be used to make yourself appear like a creature that is one size category larger or smaller than your actual size. This does not change your actual size or reach, should you enter combat while wearing such a disguise.

   If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Perception checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.
  </p>
  <p>
   An individual makes a Perception check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and again every hour thereafter. If you casually meet a large number of different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Perception modifier for the group.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Action
   </b>
   : Creating a disguise requires 1d3 × 10 minutes of work. Using magic (such as the
   <i>
    disguise self
   </i>
   spell) reduces this action to the time required to cast the spell or trigger the effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Try Again
   </b>
   : Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they&#39;ll be more suspicious.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Special
   </b>
   : Magic that alters your form, such as
   <i>
    alter self, disguise self, polymorph
   </i>
   , or
   <i>
    shapechange,
   </i>
   grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as
   <i>
    true seeing
   </i>
   ) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.
  </p>
  <p>
   You must make a Disguise check when you cast a
   <i>
    simulacrum
   </i>
   spell to determine how good the likeness is.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have the
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#deceitful">
    Deceitful
   </a>
   feat, you gain a bonus on Disguise checks (see
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html">
    Feats
   </a>
   ).
