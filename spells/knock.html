   opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to
   <i>

    </a>
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    <a href="arcaneLock.html#arcane-lock">
     arcane lock

   . When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful,
   <i>
    knock
   </i>
   opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an
   <i>
    <a href="arcaneLock.html#arcane-lock">

    </a>
    ed
   </i>
   door, the spell does not remove the
   <i>
    <a href="arcaneLock.html#arcane-lock">
     arcane lock
    </a>
   </i>
   but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
   <i>
    Knock
   </i>
   does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.
