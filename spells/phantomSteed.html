   You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mount is
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#armor-class">
    AC
   </a>
   18 (–1 size, +4 natural armor, +5
   <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#dexterity">
    Dex
   </a>
   ) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider&#39;s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
  </p>
  <p>
   These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount&#39;s abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.
